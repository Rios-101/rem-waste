Skip Hire App
This is a web app that lets you choose the perfect skip for your needs. Whether you're clearing out junk or doing a home renovation, you can easily select a skip size, see the price, and get started with your booking.

How it Works
Step-by-Step Process
The app takes you through several steps to book your skip. These include entering your postcode, choosing a waste type, selecting the right skip, and checking for permits. You'll also choose your hire period and make a payment.

Choosing the Skip Size
The main part of the app is selecting the right skip. Once you've selected a skip size, you'll see its price and hire period. You can choose a skip based on size (4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 yards).

Fetching Skip Data
The app fetches all skip details from a server. This includes images, sizes, hire periods, and pricing. If there's an issue with loading the data, an error message will show up, or a loading spinner will be displayed until the data is ready.

Key Features
Multi-Step Booking
Users follow steps like choosing the postcode, selecting waste types, picking a skip, checking for permits, and making payments.

Responsive UI
The layout adapts to different screen sizes, so it works well on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

Error Handling
If there's a problem fetching the data, you'll see a friendly error message.

Skeleton Loader
While waiting for data to load, a skeleton loader keeps things looking smooth.
